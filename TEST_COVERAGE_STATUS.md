## 📊 Baseline Coverage Measurements

### Go Ad Server
- **Coverage:** 0.0% (statements)
- **Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Issue:** Tests exist but are mocked/stubbed and don't test actual code
- **Test Files:** 2 files (ad_handler_test.go, ad_service_test.go)
- **Actual Tests:** Mock handlers only, no real code coverage

### API Gateway
- **Statements:** 16.09% (177/1100)
- **Branches:** 7.71% (26/337)
- **Functions:** 6.61% (9/136)

## 🚧 Infrastructure Status

### ✅ Completed Setup
1. **Test Databases Running:**
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5433 (adserver_test) ✅
   - Redis: localhost:6380 ✅
   - LocalStack S3: localhost:4567 ✅

2. **Database Migrations:**
   - All 4 migrations applied successfully ✅
   - Tables created: users, campaigns, creatives, ad_impressions, ad_requests, ad_clicks, ad_completions, campaign_daily_stats ✅

3. **LocalStack S3:**
   - Bucket created: ctv-ad-server-creatives ✅

4. **Test Configuration:**

### ❌ Blocking Issues

1. **API Gateway Tests Hanging:**
   - All 245 tests fail with timeout in afterAll hook
   - Cleanup queries taking >10s
   - Simplified cleanup to TRUNCATE (faster)
   - Still timing out - needs investigation

2. **Go Tests Not Covering Code:**
   - Tests are mocked and don't execute actual service code
   - Need to rewrite with real Redis/database integration
   - All handler tests need real service injection

3. **Dashboard Not Assessed:**
   - No attempt made to measure coverage yet
   - Unknown state

**Files Needing Tests:**
1. `cmd/server/main.go` - 0% coverage
   - Server initialization

   - Signal handling

2. `internal/handlers/ad_handler.go` - 0% coverage
   - HandleAdRequest with real service
   - HandleImpression with real service
   - HealthCheck with real dependencies
   - Error handling paths

3. `internal/services/ad_service.go` - 0% coverage
   - SelectAd algorithm
   - Campaign filtering logic
   - Creative selection
   - TrackImpression (Redis + HTTP POST)
   - Error cases

4. `internal/redis/client.go` - 0% coverage

## 🎯 Action Plan to Reach 90%+

### Phase 1: Fix Test Infrastructure (PRIORITY 1) ⏱️ 2-4 hours

**API Gateway Test Hanging:**
- [ ] Investigate why afterAll cleanup times out
- [ ] Check for unclosed database connections
- [ ] Check for unclosed Redis connections
- [ ] Check for hanging HTTP servers
- [ ] Add --detectOpenHandles to find leaks
- [ ] Fix all connection cleanup issues

**Go Test Infrastructure:**
- [ ] Set up test Redis instance connection
- [ ] Set up mock HTTP server for API Gateway calls
- [ ] Create test fixtures for campaigns/creatives
- [ ] Create helper functions for test data

### Phase 2: Go Ad Server to 90%+ ⏱️ 4-6 hours

**Rewrite Existing Tests:**
- [ ] Convert mocked handler tests to integration tests
- [ ] Connect to real test Redis (localhost:6380)
- [ ] Test actual SelectAd algorithm with real data
- [ ] Test impression tracking with mock HTTP server

**New Tests:**
- [ ] Redis client integration tests
- [ ] Edge cases: no campaigns, expired campaigns, over budget
- [ ] Error handling: Redis down, HTTP timeout
- [ ] Concurrency tests

**Target Files:**
```
services/ad-server/internal/
├── handlers/
│   ├── ad_handler_test.go (REWRITE)

## 🚨 Critical Blockers

1. **API Gateway Tests Hanging** 🔴
   - MUST fix before any coverage improvements
   - All 245 tests failing due to timeout
   - Blocking measurement of true coverage

2. **Go Tests Not Testing Real Code** 🔴
   - Current 0% coverage misleading
   - Tests exist but don't execute production code
   - Need complete rewrite with integration setup

3. **Large Coverage Gap** 🔴
   - Go: Need +90% coverage (from 0%)
   - API Gateway: Need +74% coverage (from 16%)
   - Dashboard: Unknown, likely need +90%

## 📝 Next Steps When You Wake Up

### Immediate Actions (First Hour):

1. **Fix API Gateway Test Hanging:**
   ```bash
   cd services/api-gateway
   npm test -- --detectOpenHandles
   # Find what's keeping process alive
   # Fix connection leaks
   ```

2. **Verify All Tests Pass:**
   ```bash
   # After fixing hangs, run all tests
   npm test -- --maxWorkers=1 --forceExit
   # Should see which tests are actually passing/failing
   ```

3. **Generate Coverage Report:**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=html
   open coverage/index.html
   # Identify uncovered files visually
   ```

### Then Follow NEXT_STEPS.md Plan:

**Phase 1:** Fix infrastructure (this is blocking everything)
**Phase 2:** Add Go tests (start with integration tests)
