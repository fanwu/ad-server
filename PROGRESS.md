## üìù Notes

### Recent Changes
- **Oct 1, 2024:** **PRIORITY CHANGE** - Building Admin UI first before ad serving
- **Oct 1, 2024:** Campaign and Creative management completed ahead of schedule
- **Oct 1, 2024:** Added comprehensive tests for S3 integration
- **Oct 1, 2024:** Added Admin UI with TypeScript to MVP scope
- **Sept 29, 2024:** All Step 1 tests passing, infrastructure complete

### Key Decisions
- **Priority Change (Oct 1):** Building Admin UI first to get visual interface ASAP
- **UI-First Approach:** Get "something visual" working in Week 2, complete features in Week 3
- **Iterative UI:** UI can be incomplete initially, will refine as we go
- **Technology Stack:** Keeping Node.js/Express for consistency
- **TypeScript:** Using strict mode for Admin UI with full type coverage
- **Testing:** Maintaining >90% coverage for all new features
- **AWS:** Using simplified MVP infrastructure (t3.micro/small instances)
- **Scope:** Deferring advanced targeting and analytics to Phase 2

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Timeline Risk:** UI development may take longer than estimated
  - *Mitigation:* Building incrementally - basic visual first, features later
  - *Mitigation:* Using shadcn/ui for rapid component development
  - *Mitigation:* Accepting incomplete UI in Week 2 for faster progress
- **Backend Dependency:** UI needs working backend API
  - *Mitigation:* Backend API already complete and tested ‚úÖ
- **Ad Serving Delay:** Ad serving pushed to Week 3
  - *Mitigation:* Still achievable in 2-3 days, well-defined scope
  - *Mitigation:* UI gives more time to think through ad serving logic
- **AWS Costs:** Infrastructure costs need monitoring
  - *Mitigation:* Using smallest viable instance sizes
- **Testing:** End-to-end UI testing may be time-consuming
  - *Mitigation:* Focus on critical paths, defer comprehensive E2E testing
