## 🚀 How to Run the Current Implementation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+ (recommended for best compatibility)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd ad-server

# 2. Run automated setup (installs dependencies, starts services, runs migrations)
npm run setup

# 3. Start the API Gateway
npm run dev
```

### Available Services
- **API Gateway:** http://localhost:3000
- **PostgreSQL:** localhost:5432 (user: adserver, db: adserver_dev)
- **Redis:** localhost:6379
- **pgAdmin:** http://localhost:8080 (admin@adserver.dev / admin)
- **RedisInsight:** http://localhost:8081
- **LocalStack:** http://localhost:4566

### Test Accounts
All accounts use password: `password123`
- `admin@adserver.dev` (admin role)
- `advertiser@adserver.dev` (advertiser role)
- `viewer@adserver.dev` (viewer role)

---

## 🧪 Testing the Current Implementation

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### 2. User Registration
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "name": "Test User"
  }'
```

### 3. User Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "advertiser@adserver.dev",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### 4. Protected Route (Campaigns)
```bash
# First get token from login, then:
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### 5. Rate Limiting Test
```bash
# Run this multiple times quickly to trigger rate limiting
for i in {1..110}; do curl http://localhost:3000/health; done
```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Week 3-4)

### Priority 1: Enhanced Database Schema for CTV Advertising

The current database schema only supports basic user authentication. We need to implement the full CTV ad server schema to support campaign management, targeting, and ad serving.

#### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Implement CTV Ad Server Database Schema**
   - Add campaigns, creatives, targeting rules tables
   - Create frequency capping and competitive separation tables
   - Add comprehensive indexes for query performance
   - Implement ad pods configuration tables

2. **Database Migration Implementation**
   - Create migration files for new schema
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Add seed data for testing different campaign types

3. **Update API Gateway to Support New Schema**
   - Replace mock campaign endpoints with real database operations
   - Implement campaign CRUD operations
   - Add creative management endpoints
   - Build targeting rule configuration

#### Required Database Schema Additions:
```sql
-- Enhanced campaigns table
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN targeting_config JSONB;
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN delivery_settings JSONB;
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN performance_goals JSONB;

-- New tables needed:
CREATE TABLE ad_requests (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    request_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    device_info JSONB,
    geo_info JSONB,
    content_context JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE impressions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    request_id VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES ad_requests(request_id),
    campaign_id UUID REFERENCES campaigns(id),
    creative_id UUID REFERENCES creatives(id),
    served_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    viewable BOOLEAN,
    completed BOOLEAN
);
```

#### New API Endpoints to Implement:
```javascript
// Campaign Management
POST   /api/v1/campaigns                    // Create campaign
GET    /api/v1/campaigns                    // List campaigns (with filters)
GET    /api/v1/campaigns/:id               // Get campaign details
PUT    /api/v1/campaigns/:id               // Update campaign
DELETE /api/v1/campaigns/:id               // Archive campaign

// Creative Management
POST   /api/v1/campaigns/:id/creatives     // Upload creative
GET    /api/v1/campaigns/:id/creatives     // List creatives
PUT    /api/v1/creatives/:id               // Update creative

// Targeting
GET    /api/v1/targeting/options           // Get targeting options
POST   /api/v1/campaigns/:id/targeting     // Set targeting rules
```

#### Estimated Time: 1-2 weeks

## 📋 Phase 2 Roadmap: Core Ad Server Functionality (Week 5-8)

### Campaign Management Service Implementation
- **Campaign Operations**: Full CRUD with budget validation
- **Creative Management**: Upload, validation, approval workflow
- **Targeting Rules Engine**: Geographic, device, content, audience targeting
- **Frequency Capping**: User/device level caps with time windows
- **Competitive Separation**: Category-based exclusion rules
- **Budget Management**: Daily pacing, tracking, alerts

### Success Metrics for Next Phase
- **API Response Time**: <50ms for ad requests
- **Database Query Performance**: <5ms for campaign lookups
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >95% coverage
- **Throughput**: Support 1,000+ requests per minute

## 🚀 Development Commands for Next Phase

```bash
# Database operations
npm run db:create-migration create_campaign_tables

npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# Testing new functionality
npm run test:campaigns        # Campaign management tests
npm run test:creatives        # Creative management tests
npm run test:targeting        # Targeting rules tests
npm run test:integration      # End-to-end campaign tests

# Development
npm run dev:campaigns         # Start campaign service
npm run dev:full             # Start all services
```
