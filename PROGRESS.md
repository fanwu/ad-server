#### Database Schema
```sql
users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'advertiser',
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
)
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Current Implementation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+ (recommended for best compatibility)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
cd ad-server

# 2. Run automated setup (installs dependencies, starts services, runs migrations)
npm run setup

# 3. Start the API Gateway
npm run dev
```

### Available Services
- **API Gateway:** http://localhost:3000
- **PostgreSQL:** localhost:5432 (user: adserver, db: adserver_dev)
- **Redis:** localhost:6379
- **pgAdmin:** http://localhost:8080 (admin@adserver.dev / admin)
- **RedisInsight:** http://localhost:8081
- **LocalStack:** http://localhost:4566

### Test Accounts
All accounts use password: `password123`
- `admin@adserver.dev` (admin role)
- `advertiser@adserver.dev` (advertiser role)
- `viewer@adserver.dev` (viewer role)

---

## 🧪 Testing the Current Implementation

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### 2. User Registration
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "name": "Test User"
  }'
```

### 3. User Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "advertiser@adserver.dev",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### 4. Protected Route (Campaigns)
```bash
# First get token from login, then:
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### 5. Rate Limiting Test
```bash
# Run this multiple times quickly to trigger rate limiting
for i in {1..110}; do curl http://localhost:3000/health; done
```
