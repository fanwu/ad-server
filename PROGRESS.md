### Technology Stack

#### Backend Services
| Component | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **API Gateway** | Node.js + Express | 22.x / 4.x | Campaign/Creative management |
| **Ad Server** | **Go + Gin** | 1.21+ | **Real-time ad serving (<10ms)** |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | 15 | Campaign/Creative metadata (source of truth) |
| **Primary Store** | **Redis** | 7 | **Ad decisions, campaign/creative data** |
| **Storage** | AWS S3 (LocalStack) | - | Creative video files |
| **Testing** | Jest + Playwright | 29.x | Unit, Integration, E2E tests |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | - | Automated testing & deployment |

#### Frontend
| Component | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Framework** | Next.js | 15.5.4 | Admin dashboard |
| **Language** | TypeScript | 5.x | Strict mode, full type coverage |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | 3.x | Utility-first CSS |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form | - | Form validation |
| **Date** | date-fns | - | Date formatting |

#### Ad Serving Architecture (Redis-First, Go-Powered)

**Redis Data Model (Primary Store for Ad Decisions):**
```
# Active campaigns (sorted by remaining budget)
ZSET active_campaigns → campaign_id:score

# Campaign data
HASH campaign:{id} → {name, budget_total, budget_spent, start_date, end_date, status}

# Campaign's creatives
SET campaign:{id}:creatives → {creative_id1, creative_id2, ...}

# Creative metadata
HASH creative:{id} → {name, video_url, duration, format, status}

# Request counting (for pacing)
INCR campaign:{id}:requests:{hour}
INCR creative:{id}:impressions:{hour}
```

**Data Sync:**
- PostgreSQL = Source of truth (Node.js writes here)
- Background job syncs PostgreSQL → Redis every 10 seconds
- On critical updates: immediate Redis update
- Redis TTL: 1 hour (forces periodic resync)

**Performance Targets:**
- Ad Request Response: **<10ms p99** (Go + Redis)
- Redis Hit Rate: **100%** (Redis is primary store, not cache)
- Throughput: 10,000+ req/sec per instance
- Impression Logging: Async, batched every 5 seconds

**Go Ad Server Flow:**
1. ZRANGE active_campaigns (all active)
2. Filter by date/budget (in-memory, Go is fast)
3. SRANDMEMBER campaign:{id}:creatives (random creative)
4. HGETALL creative:{id} (creative metadata)
5. Generate S3 presigned URL
6. Return in <10ms

- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
- Redis: localhost:6379

- **E2E Testing:** Added comprehensive Playwright tests to catch integration issues
- **Technology Stack:** Next.js 15.5.4, TypeScript strict mode, Tailwind CSS
- **LocalStack:** Free version works well for development, no persistence needed
- **Testing:** Maintaining >90% coverage for all new features
- **AWS:** Using simplified MVP infrastructure (t3.micro/small instances)
- **Scope:** Deferring advanced targeting to Phase 2

### Risks & Mitigations
- ~~**Timeline Risk:** UI development may take longer than estimated~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - UI completed ahead of schedule
- ~~**Backend Dependency:** UI needs working backend API~~ ✅ **RESOLVED** - Backend complete and tested
- **Ad Serving Implementation:** Core ad serving logic needs careful design
  - *Mitigation:* Well-defined scope (basic serving, no advanced targeting)
  - *Mitigation:* 3 days allocated for implementation and testing
  - *Mitigation:* Database schema already supports impression tracking
- **AWS Costs:** Infrastructure costs need monitoring
  - *Mitigation:* Using smallest viable instance sizes
  - *Mitigation:* Can start with even smaller instances and scale up
- **Week 4 Timeline:** AWS deployment in 1 week is aggressive
  - *Mitigation:* Using Terraform for infrastructure as code
  - *Mitigation:* Can extend timeline if needed (not customer-facing yet)
